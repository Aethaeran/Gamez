Plugins
=======

All plugins are inside <app_path>/plugins/<type_of_plugin>/
(i will say ./ is <app_path> for now on)
for now there are 6 types of plugins:
- Downloader
- Notifier
- Indexer
- Provider
- PostProcessor
- System
(all in ./plugins/__init__.py)

General Structure
-----------------

All types (of plugins) are subclasses of Plugin (./plugins/__init__.py)
and all plugins are a subclass of the given type.
All plugins should be in the respected folder in ./plugins/ e.g. ./plugins/downloaders
a new plugin shoudl be a new .py file in the type folder e.g. notifo.py (as a Notifier) in ./plugins/notifier/
At time of writing (5/3/13) i did not test sub folders or something ...
you can look in ./gamez/PluginManager.py at find_subclasses() to figure out what is indexed/searched for subclasses


To be a plugin all it needs is a class that extends any type.
    class MyPlugin(Downloader):
        pass
This should allready list and create a plugin on start.
BUT as a Downloader it will be used when we want to download a NZB/TORRENT file
the problem is that we dont have addDownload() defined and the program will crash.
(At this point there is no catching plugins errors like thisâ€¦This may change later)


Config for your plugin
----------------------

the _config attribute of a plugin is used to create configurable items for your plugin.
It also creates the gui in the settings section on the page (<app_url>/settings/)... oh yeah its a simple dict

One importend note: Each plugin can have many config instances. This allowes many instances of a indexer or notifier.
If you dont want that function for your plugin set the single attribute to True
    class Notifo(Notifier):
        _config = {'user': '',
                   'password': ''
                  }
        single = True
A notifier named Notifo with two config items and you can only have one of it... for whatever reason

Now this would ceate not two but three (3) configurable fields: user, password AND enabled
The enabled field is given to everyone without asking... deal with it
Technicaly a config item has no type ... it is determend when it is set,
they are: integer, string, bool
Because it is determent what type to use during setting and the gui changes accordingly to the type retrieved
it is addvised to use a value as defauld that is the type you want... and yes the values in the _config dict are the default init values

Hint: if the word 'password' is in the config name it will be a password text field in the gui

... oh dont use "-" in the config name or you can not save setting and it will crash or something


Advanced Config
---------------

If you are not happy with default removal of "_" and capitalization of the name you can define a human nice name for it.
the config_meta attribute (also a dict) is used for this.
    class Notifo(Notifier):
        _config = {'user': '',
                   'password': ''
                  }
        single = True
        config_meta = {'user': {'human': 'Your Notifo UserName'}}
something along these lines
There are also:
- placeholder <- sets these fancy grey placeholder texts in the input field
- TODO more doc
